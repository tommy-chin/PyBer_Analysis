# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
Originally, a data visualization was requested for all of the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. This analysis had been completed but a new analysis was requested where the total fares for each city type in the rideshare data was the primary focus. A multiple line graph would then be created to visualize this data. 
## Results
As seen in the rideshare summary dataframe and the multiple line graph created below, there is a clear distinction between rural, suburban, and urban city types. Rural cities had the least amount of rides, total drivers, and total fares. However, rural cities had the highest average fare per ride and also the highest average fare per driver. Urban cities had the greatest amount of total rides, total drivers, total fares but had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. Suburban cities was in between for the rural and urban city types.
