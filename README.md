# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
Originally, a data visualization was requested for all of the PyBer rideshare data from January to early May of 2019. This analysis had been completed but a new analysis was requested where the total weekly fares for each city type in the rideshare data was the primary focus. A multiple line graph would then be created to visual this data.
